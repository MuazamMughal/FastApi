# FastAPI Quick Start Guide

This guide helps you get started with FastAPI, including installation, running the server, and testing API endpoints.

---

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Install FastAPI

Use pip to install FastAPI:

```bash
pip install fastapi
```

### 2. Install Uvicorn

Uvicorn is an ASGI server used to serve your FastAPI application:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Server

To start the FastAPI server with live-reloading (automatically restarts the server on code changes), run:

```bash
uvicorn filename:app --reload
```

- Replace `filename` with your Python file name (without `.py` extension).
- `app` refers to the FastAPI instance in your file.

Example:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## üß™ Testing API Endpoints

To test your API directly from the terminal, you can use **HTTPie**, a user-friendly HTTP client.

### 1. Install HTTPie

```bash
pip install httpie
```

### 2. Test your API

Once the server is running, you can make requests using:

```bash
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/your-endpoint
```

Replace `/your-endpoint` with the actual endpoint you want to test.
