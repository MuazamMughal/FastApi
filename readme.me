# 📘 FastAPI Learning & Documentation Repository

Welcome to my FastAPI learning and documentation repository!  
This repo contains everything I’ve learned about FastAPI — from the basics like "Hello World" to essential concepts that make FastAPI stand out from REST and GraphQL APIs.

## 🚀 What is FastAPI?

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

### 🔥 Key Features

- **Fast**: Extremely high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support with autocomplete and type checks.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Reduce bugs by using standard Python types.
- **Modern**: Supports async and await for non-blocking code execution.
- **Flexible**: Can be used to build RESTful APIs, microservices, and more.

## 📦 Installation

Before starting, you need to install a few essential packages.

### 1. FastAPI

```bash
pip install fastapi
```

### 2. Uvicorn (ASGI server)

Used to run the FastAPI app:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

### 3. HTTPie (for testing APIs via terminal)

```bash
pip install httpie
```

### 4. HTTPX (for making async HTTP requests)

```bash
pip install httpx
```

## 🖥️ Running the FastAPI Server

To run your FastAPI server with live reloading (auto-update on file changes), use:

```bash
uvicorn filename:app --reload
```

- `filename` → your Python file (without `.py`)
- `app` → the FastAPI instance name

Example:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 🧪 Testing Endpoints

Use HTTPie to test your API endpoints directly from the terminal:

```bash
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/your-endpoint
```

Replace `/your-endpoint` with the actual route you want to test.
